Built for developers, [**KOMOJU**](https://komoju.com) is the easiest way to integrate Japanese payments into your Magento store.

The KOMOJU extension provides an easy way to accept Japanese payments for your Magento store. Credit Card payments only make up a small percentage of online payments in Japan, with KOMOJU you can accept payments in multiple ways, allowing your customers to pay in the way that suits them best.

Note: Currently the extension only allows payments for stores with JPY as the base currency.

## Account and Pricing

A KOMOJU account is required to use this extension. If you do not have a KOMOJU account yet you will need to [sign up here](https://komoju.com/) for one before using the extension. See [this link](https://komoju.com/#pricing) for pricing details.

## Features

- Allow your customers to pay with the methods you prefer best: Credit Card or Konbini
- Can test the extension with test credentials before accepting customer payments
- Simple checkout workflow
- PCI Compliant; We do the hard work of keeping your users' data secure so you don't need to worry.

## Security
Upon checkout, customers are redirected to the [KOMOJU hosted page website](https://docs.komoju.com/en/hosted_page/overview/). The customer enters their payment information directly into our secure environment so that the web shop never comes into contact with the customers payment data. Once the payment process is complete, customers will be redirected back to your store. No customer data is ever stored on the Magento server.
